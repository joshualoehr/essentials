STATISTICIAN ON A PLANE
Adapted from Raymond M. Smullyan

A statistician and his friend met one day and began relating their
travel experiences to one another. The statistician mentioned his
aversion to air travel, and when the friend inquired as to the reason,
the statistician replied:
"I have computed the probability that there will be a bomb on a 
plane," he explained, "and although this probability is low, it is
still too high for my comfort." 
Two weeks later, the friend met the statistician on a plane. 
"How come you changed your theory?" he asked.
"Oh, I didn't change my theory; it's just that I subsequently
computed the probability that there would simultaneously be _two_ 
bombs on a plane. This probability is low enough for my comfort.
So now I simply carry my own bomb."
